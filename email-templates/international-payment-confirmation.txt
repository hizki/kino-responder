Hey there <name>!
Shalom ve Yom tov!

We received your payment and we are super excited to let you know your registration to the KinoTLV Kabaret is complete! :)

As you may know, we do our best to take care of sleeping arrangements for all the international participants and we will need to know what are your arrival dates, so please book your flight soon and let us know what those are.
For more information about hosting arrangements, feel free to contact our hosting coordinator Tom - tom@emtza.net
IMPORTANT REMINDER - The 30th is Pesach eve, so some of the Israeli hosts will be away from home till the evening of the 31st. On the Holiday eve (Friday, the 30th) the airport gates and public transportation end their services at around 17:00. On the 31th public transportation will resume around 20:00. Take this under consideration while booking your flight. We advise you to arrive on the 30st.
Until then, don't forget to write down the dates in your schedule and start thinking what kind of a films you want to create :)  Tel-Aviv will be a great canvas for your ideas! 

We're here for any future questions or help needed.

Have a great week!
Hizki
