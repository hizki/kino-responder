Hi <name>!

Thanks for registering to our Fourth International Kino Kabaret in Tel-Aviv!

To validate your registration, you will soon receive an email asking to set the registration fee of 315 Shekels (about 73 Euros) via PayPal.
This payment will ensure your spot at the Kabaret, and will allow us to welcome you in the best possible conditions and prepare cool stuff towards the Kabaret ;)

We invite you to book your flight ticket to Tel-Aviv at the earliest to find the best prices. The kabaret is taking place during the Israeli Easter holidays (Pesach), so it is possible that prices will rise quickly! 

The Karabet will take place between the 1st and 6th of April, and will hold two 3-day rounds. Prior to the Karabet, on the 31st of March (Saturday), we'll hold our customary meet-and-greet party with all of this year's participants.

* PLEASE NOTE - The 30st is Pesach eve, so some of the Israeli hosts will be away from home till the evening of the 31st. On the Holiday eve (Friday, the 30th) the airport gates and public transportation end their services at around 17:00. On the 31th public transportation will resume around 20:00.

We will do our best to accommodate you by our Israeli participants and we will put you in touch with your host as soon as the registrations to the Kabaret are over.
Do not hesitate to contact us with any question. Great meeting you! :)

Cheers,
Hizki
