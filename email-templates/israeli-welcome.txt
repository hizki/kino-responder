Hi <name>!

Thanks for registering to our Fourth International Kino Kabaret in Tel-Aviv!

We are very happy you want to take part in the Kino celebration of creation :) We will soon send you an invitation for our Pre-Kabaret meeting of all the Israeli participants, where we'll further explain about the Kabaret and show show of the films that we made there. Wed love to see you!

To validate your registration, you will soon receive an email via PayPal, asking you to set the registration fee of 315 Shekels. 
This registration will allow us to produce the best possible Kabaret and to make sure you have all the facilities needed in order to build the film Lab!

Kino Kabaret relies on Cooperative Economics, and so we as a group need to find accommodation for every international participant that registers. Israelis are known as welcoming people and we have a reputation to uphold ;)
We would much appreciate if you can host a guest at your home in a room or a couch and to know that this is something we can rely on. 

Do not hesitate to contact us with any question. Great meeting you! :)

Cheers,
Hizki
